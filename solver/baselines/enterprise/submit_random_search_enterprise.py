Academic Submission Generator for Random Search Baseline Algorithm - Enterprise Configuration
Programmable Cubes Challenge - GECCO 2024 Space Optimisation Competition (SpOC)

This module executes the random search baseline optimization algorithm and
generates properly formatted submission files for the Enterprise spacecraft
assembly problem. The implementation follows academic standards for reproducible 
research and maintains comprehensive experimental records for comparative 
algorithmic analysis.

The Enterprise problem represents the most complex configuration challenge in the
competition, featuring 1472 programmable cubes requiring sophisticated optimization
strategies for effective structural assembly.

The submission system interfaces with the competition evaluation framework
while preserving detailed performance metrics and solution characteristics
for subsequent empirical studies.

Usage:
    python solver/baselines/enterprise/submit_random_search_enterprise.py

Features:
    • Rigorous random search baseline implementation for large-scale problems
    • Deterministic results through controlled random seed
    • Standards-compliant JSON submission format
    • Comprehensive performance analysis and statistical reporting
    • Automated result archival for comparative studies
