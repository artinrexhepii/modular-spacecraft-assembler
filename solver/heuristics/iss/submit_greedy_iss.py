Academic Submission Generator for ISS Greedy Heuristic Optimization Research
GECCO 2024 Space Optimization Competition (SpOC) - Academic Implementation

This module generates properly formatted competition submissions based on 
greedy heuristic optimization results for the International Space Station (ISS)
spacecraft assembly problem. The implementation facilitates rigorous academic
research by providing comprehensive performance analysis and standardized
result documentation for comparative algorithmic studies.

Academic Usage:
    python solver/heuristics/iss/submit_greedy_iss.py

Research Features:
    • Advanced greedy heuristic optimization with probabilistic exploration
    • Reproducible experimental results with comprehensive documentation
    • Performance enhancement analysis compared to baseline methods
    • Structured JSON submission format compliant with competition standards
    • Automated result storage for comparative research studies
