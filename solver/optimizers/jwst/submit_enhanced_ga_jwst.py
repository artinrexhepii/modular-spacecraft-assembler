Enhanced Genetic Algorithm Submission System for JWST Problem
Academic Research Implementation - GECCO 2024 Space Optimization Competition (SpOC)

ADVANCED ALGORITHMIC FEATURES:
- Population-based evolution with intelligent initialization
- Adaptive mutation mechanisms with convergence detection
- Solution memory banking for pattern learning
- Tournament selection with elitism preservation
- JWST-specific scaling optimization (643 cubes)
- Comprehensive experimental data collection and analysis

This implementation represents advanced genetic algorithm methodology
specifically optimized for JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) spacecraft assembly.

Research Objective: Achieve competitive performance through systematic optimization
