Enhanced Genetic Algorithm Solution Submission for ISS Problem
Programmable Cubes Challenge - GECCO 2024 Space Optimisation Competition (SpOC)

This module executes the enhanced genetic algorithm optimization for the International
Space Station spacecraft assembly problem and generates a properly formatted submission
file for competitive evaluation. The algorithm incorporates corrected fitness direction
optimization, inverse-move cleanup, adaptive mutation mechanisms, and comprehensive
performance analysis.

Key algorithmic improvements include:
- Corrected fitness direction optimization (negative values indicate superior solutions)
- All selection, elitism, and crossover operators properly configured
- Inverse-move cleanup for enhanced solution efficiency
- Adaptive mutation rate adjustment for stagnation prevention

Target Performance: Achieve fitness of -0.991 or superior for championship-level results

Usage:
    python solver/optimizers/iss/submit_ga_iss.py

Dependencies:
    - numpy: Numerical array operations
    - json: Submission file formatting
    - time: Performance timing analysis
